## About Me

Hello! I am a Predoctoral Master's Student at the University of Chicago where I am currently advised by [Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com/). I have been fortunate to work alongside Professor [Shinji Watnabe](https://www.wavlab.org/) from Carnegie Mellon Univerity and [Karen Livescu](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/) from TTIC on other collaborations.

My current research interests are in **Speech Processing and NLP**. Specifically, I have been working towards creating lightweight architectures in my previous and current works on Speech Processing. In my work with NLP, I have focused on exploring the use of LLMs as tools. The following are some directions I am exploring/would love to explore: 
* development of foundation models for Audio
* interpretability of models (for both Audio and Text)
* multi-agent frameworks
* AI + science/social science

I am currently interning at Lawrence Livermore National Labs, where I am working on LLM evaluation and benchmarking.

If you are interested in collaborating or just talking, feel free to reach out to me at tejess@uchicago.edu!
